// Adapted version from UEFI-RS:
// https://github.com/rust-osdev/uefi-rs/blob/main/uefi/src/helpers/logger.rs

//! This optional feature adds support for the `log` crate, providing
//! a custom logger implementation which writes to a UEFI text output protocol.
//!
//! The main export of this module is the `Logger` structure,
//! which implements the `log` crate's trait `Log`.
//!
//! # Implementation details
//!
//! The implementation is not the most efficient, since there is no buffering done,
//! and the messages have to be converted from UTF-8 to UEFI's UCS-2.
//!
//! The last part also means that some Unicode characters might not be
//! supported by the UEFI console. Don't expect emoji output support.
